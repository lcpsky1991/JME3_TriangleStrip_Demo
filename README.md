# jMonkeyEngine 3 TriangleStrip Demo

This was part of a task at our computer graphics course at the university.

The basic task was to draw meshes with a single triangle strip.
This project contains a plain and a sphere drawn from a single triangle strip.

The objects can be parameterized in real time with key binding.
